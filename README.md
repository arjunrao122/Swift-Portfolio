# Swift Programming

Welcome to my collection of projects showcasing my skills and experiments with Swift, iOS development, and related technologies. This repository serves as a portfolio of my work in various areas of app development, from user interface design to integration with web services and machine learning.

## Projects Overview

In this repository, you'll find a range of applications and experiments, including:

- Sample apps utilizing SwiftUI for layout and design.
- Implementations of design patterns such as Protocol & Delegation.
- Integration of iOS features like Location Services, MapKit, and Gesture Recognizers.
- Exploration of machine learning with Core ML.

Each project directory contains its own README with more details about the specific technologies and concepts applied.

## Technologies and Concepts

Here's a brief rundown of the key technologies and concepts showcased in this repository:

### Interface Design

- SwiftUI: Modern declarative UI framework introduced in iOS 13.

### iOS Patterns and Controls

- Protocols and Delegation: Design patterns for communication between app components.
- View Controllers: Lifecycle and management of iOS app views.
- Tab Bar Controller: Usage in creating multi-tabbed interfaces.
- UIStackView & Auto Layout: Techniques for responsive UI design.

### Persistence and Web Services

- NSUserDefaults: Simple data persistence.
- UITableView: Displaying lists of data.
- Interacting with Web Services: Networking calls to RESTful APIs.

### Advanced iOS Features

- MapKit & Core Location: Implementing maps and handling location data.
- Local Notifications: Scheduling and managing notifications.
- UIImagePickerController & Core Image: Working with images and applying filters.

### Apple Watch and Machine Learning

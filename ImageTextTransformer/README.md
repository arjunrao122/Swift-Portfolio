# ImageTextTransformer

## Overview
ImageTextTransformer is an innovative iOS application built using SwiftUI. It seamlessly integrates image processing and text recognition, allowing users to apply filters to images and extract textual information. The project leverages SwiftUI for the user interface, Core Image for applying filters, and the Vision framework for text recognition.

## Features
- Image Filtering: Apply various filters like Blur and Binarization to images.
- Dynamic Filter Adjustment: Use a slider to adjust the intensity of the filters.
- Text Recognition: Extract text from both filtered and original images using Apple's Vision framework.
- SwiftUI Interface: A clean and responsive user interface built entirely in SwiftUI.
- Easy Image Switching: Switch between different sample images with a simple button tap.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/arjunrao122/Swift-Portfolio.git
    cd Swift-Portfolio/FilterTextSwiftUI
    ```
2. Open the `.xcodeproj` file in Xcode.

## Usage
Select an image from the predefined list and choose a filter from the segmented control. Adjust the filter intensity using the slider (applicable for certain filters). The application will display the recognized text from the current image in the text view below.

## Requirements
- iOS 14.0 or later
- Xcode 12 or later

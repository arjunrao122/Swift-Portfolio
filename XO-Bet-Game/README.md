# XO-Bet-Game

XO-Bet-Game is a simple, yet engaging iOS game built with SwiftUI. It combines elements of classic slot machines with the universally known "Tic-Tac-Toe" (XO) game. Players can bet their credits, spin the grid, and attempt to match a row of X's or O's to win.

## Features

- Simple Gameplay: Tap to bet and play, trying to line up X's or O's.
- Credit Management: Start with a default credit balance and bet with each spin.
- Winning Mechanics: Win credits for lining up three of a kind.

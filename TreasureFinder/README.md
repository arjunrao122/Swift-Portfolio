# TreasureFinder

- Interactive Map: The app includes a custom map view showing the precise locations of treasures.
- Search Functionality: Treasures can be filtered by ID, type, or owner using the search bar.
- Dynamic UI: Background colors of treasure cells change dynamically based on the value of the treasures.
